# Light-It Playwright Automation Framework

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

**a. Why did you choose them?**
Because they cover the business-critical flows: being able to log in, add a product to the cart, and complete a purchase.

**b. What validations would you include in each?**
Visualization checks and value matching against expected results were added, but the validations could be made more robust by ensuring each object has a unique ID and follows a specific format.

## üõë Problems, Errors, and Blockers Encountered

The main challenge was creating the locators. Some elements had a field similar to `data-test`, others had `id` but it wasn‚Äôt unique, and the same issue appeared with `class` attributes. Because of that, I had to use different methods to define the elements within the locators.

Another problem appeared when re-running the test for adding a product to the cart. Since more than one product was present, the locator broke. I solved this by searching based on the product text that had been previously added.
